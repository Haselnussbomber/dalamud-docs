:::warning\[Dalamud.NET.Sdk Migration]

If you haven't done so yet, we strongly recommend
[migrating your plugin project to Dalamud.NET.Sdk](/plugin-development/how-tos/v12-sdk-migration),
especially if you are still using a targets file to reference the Dalamud SDK.
We no longer plan to support the targets file in the next API level.

It includes the latest version of DalamudPackager, pinned to the current API
level, and will make it easier for us to introduce changes to how we distribute
SDK files in the future.
